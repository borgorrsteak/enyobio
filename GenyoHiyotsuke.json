Another is lapidary-related artisanship. This can be engraving, metalwork, or enameling, amongst others. Due to the technical knowledge required of these hobbies, it follows that reading would be another one essential to his skillset. \n**Habits:** He dresses to fit his surroundings. This is why he‚Äôs in colorful, traditional garb onboard *Haraita*, but wears a regular suit or business casual on land. \n**Skills:** Expounding on hobbies, Enyo has an eye for both discerning or creating objets d‚Äôart. Though sometimes he may fiddle with an object or two that‚Äôs intended to have magical value, or has it inherently (attaching gem mounts of wizard staves or wands, for example). \n**Ambitions:** Likely to provide for his child and be a good father from afar.

Enyo was the second out of seven siblings. In the city he grew up in, there was more crime than honest work. Even if his parents forced him into it, by virtue of being born second son eldest, it wouldn't be long before he was influenced. You see, as a precocious child, he developed a knack for being a sneak thief. Enyo and his siblings used to drive the family costard cart into the busiest thoroughfares of the city. He always came back with profit, even if half the produce was left unsold. \n\nHis mother found him rotten. She swore one day he'd fuck up so grandly, that it'd cost them. \n\nLong before that, he was punished in his own way for being \"a splitting image of drunken bastard father,\" who barely came home. He was promptly held back from meals whenever suspected of stealing something again. To his paranoid mother, this gradually became an everyday occurrence. But instead of disciplining him, Enyo's situation further emboldened him. To the delight of his siblings, he'd confide no need for the pity. Instead, he showed his hand full of morsels and trinkets, snatched from right under their mother's nose. He promised to provide for them eventually, if only they could trust in his expertise, his guidance.\n\nThat was his hubris. Enyo would never settle for the grit and toil their mother thought was the right path. \n\nAmbition got the better of him. Enyo made an elaborate little network out of his own family. He'd even taken other street urchins into the fold. Unwanted children who had nothing better to do, and no education to do better with their lives in general. Some were brushes and colliders. Others decoys. Smaller ones were purse-lifters. Enyo did the talking when needed. Years of pushing the produce cart meant he'd learn to people-watch. He was good at copying what he heard. \n** **","timestamp":"2024-01-18T13:52:58.683000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-01-19T20:12:40.339000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":25,"userName":"zephtre"},{"id":"1197539242998505622","channel_id":"1196555442340499567","author":{"id":"469718795393433610","username":"zephtre","global_name":"Spectre","avatar":"31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"clan":null},"content":"But nothing was foolproof. Failure was inevitable. It wasn't Enyo that got caught, but his little sister. Babbling and hysterical, she broke easily. When the blame was pointed on him, Enyo did what most older brothers would do. He took the blame and offered his wrists up. She was forgiven, of course. Who were they but children left to the mercy of their parents mistakes? Perhaps he saw hope that his siblings would turn out better than he did. Or, there was a deeper selfishness. Enyo didn't want to be a costermonger his whole life. Maybe he wanted to run away, all while absolving him of the responsibility over his siblings. Juvy was an escape. \n\nHe never reached that place. Instead, he was taken to a jailhouse in another part of town. Enyo had, by proficiency, gained somewhat of a reputation as a fingersmith. The authorities were looking for the boy who'd arranged the \"fever filching\" case. When, as a wildly infectious flu spread throughout their quarter of the city, Enyo stumbled into a crowd with fever blisters and a dramatic death ... courtesy of griming up his draconic scales, coughing gelatin \"sputum\" and other sallow-faced, choleric makeup. He emptied a restaurant this way. Crowd hysteria made it easy to steal. Why, some were daft enough to just leave their handbags and wallets there! \n\nThe jailhouse, as it turned out, was a place for *selling.* And talent was the commodity of choice. The place was so corrupt, that cops were in payroll to the local crime lords. As an extra side gig, they sought to sell whoever they deemed could turn a tidy profit to seedy underground elements. Enyo was quickly snapped up by one such gang. There were smaller gangs providing auxiliary services to bigger yakuza and triad giants. They specialized in *tekiya*, the transport of stolen and smuggled goods, and *bakuto*, incorrigible gambling. \n** **","timestamp":"2024-01-18T13:53:24.734000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-01-19T20:11:36.283000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":26,"userName":"zephtre"},{"id":"1197539288066310256","channel_id":"1196555442340499567","author":{"id":"469718795393433610","username":"zephtre","global_name":"Spectre","avatar":"31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"clan":null},"content":"Enyo could never return to his family.

The creature he shifts into is a *ry≈´* or *mizuchi*, a type of Eastern dragon associated with bodies of water. \n\n**Power**: Shapeshifting\n\n- **Description:** He can shapeshift into his [dragon form](https://discord.com/channels/1171802933596266580/1197544262309523568/1197544497152807043) As a dragon, this grants him immense strength and endurance typical to his size (he‚Äôs nearly 30 ft long). Enyo can fly like most dragons, but since he has no wings and is a sea-aligned dragon, this is limited. He can ‚Äúborrow‚Äù a quarter of that strength by shifting parts of his body (tail, scales, claws, fangs). Enyo also has a supernatural healing factor, allowing him to heal mortal wounds faster than humans would. \n\n- **Strengths:** Specifically as a mizuchi, he can breathe underwater. Essential when working on a ship. His healing also makes him annoyingly persistent and extends his stamina. \n\n- **Weaknesses:** Transforming fully requires a ton of energy, so he rarely does it. Enyo always ends up lethargic, if not passed out, if he stays a dragon for too long (a few minutes only). When he tries to fly, that takes up even more energy. Less than a handful of people have ever seen him fly. Swimming is his stronger suit. As a type of yokai, he‚Äôs resistant to mortal wounds and weapons, but prone to magical attacks of similar affinity (East asian ones like taoist, buddhist, onmy≈çd≈ç etc). General magic weakness is fire-affix magic/weaponry, since he‚Äôs a water dragon. \n\n- **Constraints:** Healing only works when submerged in water, specifically naturally-occurring. This mean seas, lakes, rivers, etc., linked to nature. So he can‚Äôt just open a faucet or pour bottled water. Most importantly, he does have a magical artifact that enables his shapeshifting. Much like how selkies have a pelt, mizuchi keep a sacred jewel called a *Nyoih≈çju / CintƒÅma·πái*. It‚Äôs comprised of a nacreous, accumulated excess mana. They can‚Äôt transform without it nearby. \n** **","timestamp":"2024-01-18T13:56:23.586000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-01-18T14:21:57.984000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":33,"userName":"zephtre"},{"id":"1197540146292199494","channel_id":"1196555442340499567","author":{"id":"469718795393433610","username":"zephtre","global_name":"Spectre","avatar":"31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"clan":null},"content":"** **","timestamp":"2024-01-18T13:57:00.096000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-01-18T14:04:04.253000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1197540146074099795","filename":"84831AA1-F1B6-4CC3-AFEC-329CDC52CD3B.jpg","size":366233,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1196555442340499567/1197540146074099795/84831AA1-F1B6-4CC3-AFEC-329CDC52CD3B.jpg?ex=6669006c&is=6667aeec&hm=ef5e3c08791b8f5ae9028c00c5361f875282023f7c19ded6a1acf83545827c59&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1196555442340499567/1197540146074099795/84831AA1-F1B6-4CC3-AFEC-329CDC52CD3B.jpg?ex=6669006c&is=6667aeec&hm=ef5e3c08791b8f5ae9028c00c5361f875282023f7c19ded6a1acf83545827c59&","width":2224,"height":1111,"placeholder":"TfgFC4J5SZeFVwh4ILEBFFs=","placeholder_version":1,"content_type":"image/jpeg","content_scan_version":1}],"embeds":[],"reactions":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":34,"userName":"zephtre"},{"id":"1197540587822383285","channel_id":"1196555442340499567","author":{"id":"469718795393433610","username":"zephtre","global_name":"Spectre","avatar":"31645cdb5065baf99e4febcefa99c7f6","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"clan":null},"content":"** **\n## Other\n** **\n**Credits:** Art by [@shigurefusawa](https://twitter.com/shigurefusawa?lang=en) and [@ruoganzhua](https://twitter.com/ruoganzhua)\n\n### Quick Navigation \n\n[Basic Information](https://discord.com/channels/1171802933596266580/1196555442340499567/1197536679418925076) | [Appearance](https://discord.com/channels/1171802933596266580/1196555442340499567/1197537020839481394 ) | [Temperament](https://discord.com/channels/1171802933596266580/1196555442340499567/1197537609614884904) | [Disposition](https://discord.com/channels/1171802933596266580/1196555442340499567/1197537904164081704)\n[NSFW Information](https://discord.com/channels/1171802933596266580/1196555442340499567/1197538238299132076) | [History](https://discord.com/channels/1171802933596266580/1196555442340499567/1197538859106439279) | [Background](https://discord.com/channels/1171802933596266580/1196555442340499567/1197539514365788170) | [Species](https://discord.com/channels/1171802933596266580/1196555442340499567/1197539977001717892)\n\n[Click here to go back to the very top.](https://discord.com/channels/1171802933596266580/1196555442340499567/1196555442340499567)","timestamp":"2024-01-18T13:58:45.365000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":35,"userName":"zephtre"}]
